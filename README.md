Testing out commit and push


The echo-server and echo-client work together to mimic an actual server and a client, you will need to terminal windows
open, one for te client and one for the server.

Run ./echo-server.py and sudo python ./echo-client.py to get messages passed between them.
Prints 'Hello World' on the client server.
